# Assessment (GH issue viewer)

For this assessment we would like you to make a small web app that makes it possible to view a list with issues from a public GitHub repo. You’ll have to use the Github API to build it

**Functional requirements**

- Next.js App or Expo app
- User can input Github Organization & Repo (for example vercel/nextjs)
- User should be able to view the issues
- User should be able to scroll trough and when they reach the bottom, new issues should load

**Technical requirements**

- Static types (typescript)
- Proper UI/UX
- No Redux

**Bonus points**

- Being able to sort the issues, and/or:
- Having some nice animations, and/or:
- Persistence and cache management with react-query

The total time spend on the assessment shouldn’t be more than 4 to 5 hours. When finished, we’d love to see the source code, a working demo on a public url or expo link and a short video (max 5 minutes) walking us trough the codebase.

In case of any questions, let us know!
